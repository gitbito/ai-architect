# BitoAIArchitect MCP - Usage Instructions

## Rule: Always Call BitoAIArchitect Tools First

**For ANY question about code, repos, architecture, features, or implementation:**
- Call BitoAIArchitect tools IMMEDIATELY (don't ask permission)
- Use IN PARALLEL with local file exploration
- BitoAIArchitect has indexed data local tools can't see

## When to Use (Auto-Trigger)

Call BitoAIArchitect when user asks about:
- Repositories, services, projects, codebases
- "What can/does", "is there", "do we have", "find"  
- Architecture, design, patterns, structure
- Dependencies, integrations, relationships
- Tech stack, frameworks, libraries
- "How to implement/add/create/build"
- "Where is/should", "which repo"

## Tools

**Always start with:**
- `searchRepositories` - Find repos by keyword/tech/functionality
- `getRepositoryInfo` - Get repo details (current or any other)
- `listRepositories` - Browse all available repos

**Use when relevant:**
- `listClusters` - See grouped services
- `getClusterInfo` - Understand multi-repo relationships

## Quick Rules

✅ Call BitoAIArchitect + explore local files in parallel  
✅ Use searchRepositories for "is there/do we have" questions  
✅ Check getRepositoryInfo even if repo seems obvious  
✅ Never ask permission - just call tools  

❌ Never skip BitoAIArchitect because you see local files  
❌ Never ask "Would you like me to search?"

**BitoAIArchitect knows:** What repos exist, dependencies, tech stacks, capabilities, architecture  
**Local files show:** Implementation details, current code

**Use BOTH for complete answers.**
